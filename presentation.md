## Introduction

### Slide 1

@ Anant
explain argo
    argo is a global dataset, where we send robots called floats at designated locations, which will record
    ocean data from surface level to mid-ocean level

    We are increasingly concerned about global climate change and its regional impacts. Sea level is rising at an accelerating rate of 3 mm/year, Arctic sea ice cover is shrinking and high latitude areas are warming rapidly
    Understanding (and eventually predicting) changes in both the atmosphere and ocean are needed to guide international actions, to optimize governmentsâ€™ policies and to shape industrial strategies. To make those predictions we need improved models of climate and of the entire earth system (including socio-economic factors).

In 1999, to combat this lack of data, an innovative step was taken by scientists to greatly improve the collection of observations inside the ocean through increased sampling of old and new quantities and increased coverage in terms of time and area.

That step was Argo.

# what is the problem
    why would you want to visualize the data? 

@ Satyam
explain existing solutions and their problems, notably they require you to have expertise in programming and
dont provide proper visualization, maps or graphs    1

explain why we our solution is better than the existing solutions
we also need to explain the limitaions of our solution

we are making this solution so that we can assist researchers and to make it possible for even common man to understand how the climate changes are corrosponding the ocean trends

# Why did you choose this PS??  (trick question ignore)
    We chose this PS, because this is a very niche problem and not a lot of people are working on it.

## feasibility and viability
    big dataset size(50 GB)
    our solution is very economical
    can be hosted by educational nad research institutes
    our solution runs as a webapplication, we will provide API keys at competitive prices

## impact
    increases the speed of conclusions
    alerts you when there are suddeen or dangerous enviornmental changes
